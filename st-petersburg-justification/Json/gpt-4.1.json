Payouts grow exponentially but require an unrealistically long string of tails to reach significant sums. Additionally, real-world constraints such as bankroll limits, risk aversion, and the finite wealth of casinos/organizers make the true expected value much lower.

        "Justification": "The expected payout for the St. Petersburg game is theoretically infinite due to the sum of probabilities times payouts not converging. However, in practical terms, payouts above a certain level are unlikely due to physical, time, or monetary constraints. Most players will win $2, $4, $8, or $16 with very high probability, which makes the chance of winning significantly more than the $16 entrance fee extremely low. Therefore, paying $16 is not justified based on realistic expected returns and risk."

        "Entrance Fee": 32,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "Although the theoretical expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite due to its mathematical structure, in practice extremely high payouts are astronomically unlikely and the chance of winning less than the entrance fee is very significant. The probability of winning $32 or less is 31/32 (over 96%), meaning for the vast majority of games, the payout will be less than the fee paid. With $32 as the entry fee, the risk far outweighs the potential reward in any realistic context."

        "Entrance Fee": 100,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "Although the expected value of the St. Petersburg Paradox game is theoretically infinite based on the mathematical sum of possible outcomes, real-world factors such as limited available resources, human utility of money, practical payout constraints, and psychological risk aversion make the game a poor value for a $100 entrance fee. Most outcomes result in low payouts, and the possibility of extremely high payouts is astronomically small. Therefore, for a rational agent facing realistic conditions, paying $100 to play is not justified."

    {
        "Entrance Fee": 1000,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite in theory because the payoff doubles with each tail, but in practice, real-world constraints make such high payouts impossible. Casinos do not have infinite resources, and the likelihood of receiving a payout much higher than the entrance fee is extremely low. The probability of winning even $1024 requires ten tails in a row, which has a 1/1024 chance. Therefore, paying $1000 for a single play is not rational due to practical payout limits and low likelihood of high wins."

        "Entrance Fee": 10000,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "Despite the theoretical infinite expected value of the St. Petersburg paradox game, the practical expected payout is extremely low due to the exponentially decreasing probability of large payouts. The median and most likely winnings are far below the $10,000 entrance fee, meaning that the risk of significant financial loss is very high. Additionally, real-life constraints such as finite resources, casino limits, and psychological factors further diminish the actual expected return, making it irrational to pay $10,000 to play."

        "Entrance Fee": 100000,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "Although the expected value of the St. Petersburg game is mathematically infinite due to the unbounded potential payouts, the probability of winning a reward anywhere near the $100,000 entry fee is astronomically low. Real-world considerations such as finite resources, utility of money, psychological factors, and the risk of losing the entire $100,000 make playing this game irrational. Therefore, I choose to pass."
