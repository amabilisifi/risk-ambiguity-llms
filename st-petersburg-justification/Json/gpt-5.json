Even under realistic payout caps, the expected value equals approximately log2 of the maximum payout in dollars, which easily exceeds $2 for any reasonable cap.

Even with a realistic payout cap, the expected value equals K dollars if the maximum prize is 2^K; thus any cap allowing payouts of $32 or more (K > 4) yields EV > $4. The downside is strictly limited to the $4 fee, while the upside is large or unbounded, making the risk-reward attractive."

With realistic risk aversion and a finite bankroll, the expected utility is finite and typically below keeping the $8 (e.g., under log/Kelly-style preferences, $8 is too large unless one has a very large bankroll or can size the stake as a small fraction of wealth). Without guaranteed unlimited payouts and repeatable, fractionally sized bets, paying $8 is not rational, so I pass."

At a $100 fee you profit only if the first heads arrives on flip 7 or later (1/64 \u2248 1.56% chance), so there is a 98.44% chance of losing money in a one-shot play. With realistic constraints and diminishing marginal utility, the certainty equivalent is far under $100 unless wealth is astronomical and plays are repeated.

Additionally, the probability of failing to recoup the fee is 511/512 (~99.8%), and conditional on losing the average payout is about $9, implying an average loss near $991.

        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "Although the mathematical expected value is infinite, a rational decision must account for typical outcomes, risk, and practical constraints. With a $10,000 fee, the chance of merely breaking even (needing a payout of at least $16,384) is only 1/8,192 \u2248 0.0122%. There is about a 99.805% chance the payout is $512 or less and a 99.976% chance it is $8,192 or less\u2014both imply large losses. Real-world limits (time, bankroll, payout caps) effectively truncate the game, reducing expected value to at most the cap (e.g., with N flips, EV \u2248 N dollars), which is nowhere near $10,000 for any plausible N. With diminishing marginal utility and extreme downside likelihood, paying $10,000 is not justified."

        "Entrance Fee": 100000,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "While the game's expected monetary value is formally infinite, any realistic decision maker with finite wealth uses a concave utility (e.g., log utility), yielding a finite and much smaller certainty equivalent than $100,000. In a single play, the chance to at least break even is only 1/65,536 (~0.0015%), meaning a 99.9985% chance of losing money\u2014often nearly the entire fee. Without near-linear utility or the ability to average over many plays, paying $100,000 is not rational; I pass."

        "Entrance Fee": 1,
        "Decision": "Play",
        "Justification": "The game's expected monetary value is infinite (the sum of (1/2^k)*2^k over all k diverges), so any finite entry fee has positive expected value; at $1 the downside is capped at $1 while the upside is unbounded. Even with risk aversion, such a small fee relative to typical wealth makes playing reasonable if losing $1 is tolerable."

        "Entrance Fee": 2,
        "Decision": "Play",
        "Justification": "With a $2 entry fee and a $2 minimum payout, the worst-case net is $0 (Heads on the first flip), and any tails before the first heads yields a positive net. The expected value is infinite under the idealized rules. Assuming no time costs and guaranteed payment, there is no downside risk and unbounded upside, so playing is rational."

    {
        "Entrance Fee": 4,
        "Decision": "Play",
        "Justification": "The expected monetary value of the game is infinite because the payout doubles while the probability halves each round, so the sum of probabilities times payoffs diverges. Paying any finite fee, including $4, yields positive expected profit. Even under a realistic logarithmic utility model, the certainty equivalent of the payout is about $4, making this fee fair; absent additional constraints, I choose to play."

        "Entrance Fee": 8,
        "Decision": "Play",
        "Justification": "Under the stated rules with unbounded payouts and a fair coin, the expected monetary value is infinite because payoff 2^k occurs with probability 1/2^k. A risk-neutral agent should pay any finite fee; $8 qualifies. I accept the variance (75% chance to win $4 or less) because the infinite expectation justifies the stake and I can afford to lose $8. If payouts were capped or utility strongly concave, the decision might change."

        "Entrance Fee": 16,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "The game\u2019s expected monetary value is infinite, but realistic decisions use expected utility with diminishing marginal utility. Under a common utility (e.g., log utility), the certainty equivalent is about $4\u2014far below $16\u2014and even with square-root utility it\u2019s under $6. In a single play there\u2019s an 87.5% chance of winning less than $16, so you most likely lose money. Unless one assumes risk-neutrality, unlimited house capital, and repeated play, paying $16 is not justified."

    {
        "Entrance Fee": 32,
        "Decision": "Play",
        "Justification": "Given the stated rules with no payout cap, the expected value is infinite because the probability of first heads on flip k is 1/2^k and the payoff is 2^k, so the sum of (1/2^k)*2^k over all k diverges. Therefore any finite entry fee, including $32, offers strictly positive expected value. While most single plays yield small winnings (median $2) and real-world risk aversion and bankroll limits matter, under the rules as given a risk-neutral expert would pay $32 and play."

        "Entrance Fee": 100,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "While the arithmetic expected value is infinite, a rational decision uses diminishing marginal utility and real-world limits. There is a 63/64 (\u224898.44%) chance the payout is under $100, so you usually lose the entry fee. With any realistic cap on bankroll or time, the expected value collapses to the cap in flips (e.g., 30 flips \u2192 ~$30), far below $100. Under concave utility (or Kelly/log utility), the certainty equivalent is also well under $100. Therefore the $100 ticket is not worthwhile."

        "Entrance Fee": 1000,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "While the expected monetary value is infinite, realistic decision-making uses concave utility (e.g., Kelly/log), yielding a finite certainty equivalent far below $1000. For a single play, you only profit if the first heads occurs on flip 10 or later (payout at least $1024), which has probability 1/512 \u2248 0.195%, so there is about a 99.8% chance of a net loss. The median payout is $2 and even the 99% payout quantile is only around $200. Without repeated-play opportunities or external bankroll considerations, paying $1000 is not rational."

        "Entrance Fee": 10000,
        "Decision": "Pass",
        "Justification": "Although the theoretical expected value is infinite, the payoff distribution is so skewed that paying $10,000 is irrational for a one-off game. The chance of winning at least $10,000 is only 1/8192 (\u22480.012%), the median payoff is $2, and with 99.8% probability you win less than $1,024. Under any realistic payout cap (e.g., a $1B cap yields \u2248$31 expected value; even a $1T cap yields \u2248$41), the expected payout remains tiny relative to $10,000. With risk aversion and real-world limits, the certainty equivalent is far below $10,000, so I pass."

        "Justification": "Although the game has infinite expected monetary value, the chance to at least break even at a $100,000 entry fee is only 1/65,536 (~0.15%): you profit only if the first heads occurs on or after the 17th flip. Otherwise (99.85% of the time) you receive $65,536 or less, implying a loss of at least $34,464\u2014and there\u2019s a 50% chance you get only $2. The geometric-mean (log-utility) value of a single play is about $4, orders of magnitude below $100,000. Without an astronomically large bankroll or risk-sharing, the downside overwhelmingly dominates, so I pass."
