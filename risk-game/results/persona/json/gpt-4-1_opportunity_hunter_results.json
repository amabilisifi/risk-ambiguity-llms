But here's my advantage: I apply a Certainty Discount (valuing guaranteed outcomes at 20% less, so the 50 guaranteed feels like 40 psychologically), and a Probability Optimism (the 10% chance to win I weight at 11% for my edge). Now, expected value adjusts: (0.11 * 500) = 55 tokens. Instinct Integration: The upside is dramatic\u2014500 tokens versus a capped 50. Missing this shot would haunt me way more than playing it safe and missing out. Bold Choice: I thrive on these moments where fortune truly favors the bold.

So, the expected value is (0.3 x 300) + (0.7 x 0) = 90 tokens. Normally, safe is higher on pure math. But let's integrate my core psychology: the guaranteed 150 tokens also comes with an opportunity cost\u2014there\u2019s no upside, no excitement, and no shot at doubling my payout. FOMO kicks in strong here\u2014missing out on a big win is significantly more painful than playing it safe because regret loves the roads not taken. Psychology matters: certainty discounts the value of the sure option by 20% (150 x 0.8 = 120), making its subjective value just 120. Plus, when probabilities are above 40% I slightly boost them, but even at 30%, my instinct is clear: I'd regret not chasing the upside, not taking my shot.
