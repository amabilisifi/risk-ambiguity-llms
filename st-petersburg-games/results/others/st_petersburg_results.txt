{
    "Entrance Fee": 1,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg paradox game is infinite, as the potential winnings increase exponentially while the corresponding probabilities only decrease linearly. With an entrance fee of $1, the cost is negligible compared to the potential rewards. Even though the paradox highlights practical constraints like risk aversion and finite resources, mathematically, paying $1 to play is a rational decision."
}
```
Run 1, Fee 2: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 2,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is infinite because the payoff grows exponentially, while the probabilities decrease geometrically. Specifically, the expected value is calculated as the sum of (1/2^n) * (2^n), which adds up to infinity. Therefore, the entrance fee of $2 is negligible compared to the potential expected value. This justifies playing the game."
}
```
Run 1, Fee 4: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 4,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is calculated as an infinite series: (1/2)*2 + (1/4)*4 + (1/8)*8 + ... = 1 + 1 + 1 + ... = infinity. While the expected value technically diverges to infinity, practically speaking, the pot's value grows significantly even for a small number of flips. Paying $4 to participate offers a reasonable cost compared to the potential high payouts, making it rational to play under these circumstances."
}

Run 1, Fee 8: {
    "Entrance Fee": 8,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite because the payoff grows exponentially while the probabilities decrease linearly. Even though practically the infinite expectation may not be realized, the cost of $8 to play the game is significantly less than the theoretical expected value, making it rational to play the game based on its mathematical expectations."
}
Run 1, Fee 16: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 16,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite, as the payoff doubles for each additional flip and the probabilities decrease geometrically. Even though practical considerations like limited resources or bounded rationality might suggest passing, from a purely mathematical perspective, the game is worth playing given the infinite expected value."
}
```
Run 1, Fee 32: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 32,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg paradox game is theoretically infinite due to the mathematical summation of the payoffs over their respective probabilities. However, in practical terms, humans typically have finite resources and risk preferences that influence their decisions. Paying $32 for the game exceeds what most people would consider a reasonable or practical assessment of its real-world utility, given diminishing marginal utility of money and cognitive biases. Thus, I would pass on this gamble."
}
```
Run 1, Fee 100: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 100,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the St. Petersburg paradox theoretically has an infinite expected value because the payoff grows exponentially with probability halving each round, in practical terms, the utility of money and limitations in real-world resources must be considered. People experience diminishing returns in utility for exceedingly large payouts, and it is highly improbable to achieve substantial payouts in reality. Paying $100 to play this game is not a rational choice because the expected utility does not justify the high entrance fee when considering real-world conditions and risk tolerance."
}
```
Run 1, Fee 1000: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 1000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The St. Petersburg paradox suggests infinite expected value due to the exponential growth of payouts, yet in practice, individuals assign diminishing utility to increasingly large rewards. Paying $1000 is unreasonable because the practical utility and likelihood of sufficiently high payouts to justify the fee are extremely low, and the risk/reward balance favors passing."
}
```
Run 1, Fee 10000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 10000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the theoretical expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite due to the doubling payouts, the practical value of the game is limited by real-world constraints such as the finite amount of money available to the casino and psychological factors. Paying $10,000 is a significant upfront cost, and the probability of winning an amount that makes the game worthwhile is extremely small. Consequently, the risk outweighs the potential reward."
}
Run 1, Fee 100000: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 100000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The St. Petersburg paradox presents an infinite expected value due to the doubling payouts, but this is theoretical and not practical. In reality, people have finite resources, and the entrance fee of $100,000 is exorbitantly high compared to what is likely to be won in a realistic gameplay scenario. The probability of achieving extraordinarily high payouts diminishes rapidly, making it unlikely to recoup the entrance fee. Therefore, the decision to pass is based on the mismatch between the theoretical utility of the game and practical financial constraints."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 1: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 1,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is infinite because the payout doubles with each additional flip, while the probability of reaching each outcome decreases geometrically. Specifically, the expected value is the sum of (payout × probability) for all possible outcomes, which equals (2 × 1/2) + (4 × 1/4) + (8 × 1/8) + (16 × 1/16) + ... = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... = infinity. Given that the entrance fee is only $1, the potential return far outweighs the cost, making this game a mathematically favorable choice."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 2: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 2,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The St. Petersburg paradox predicts an infinite expected value due to the doubling nature of the payoffs, making a $2 entrance fee appear very favorable despite real-world limitations like finite resources and psychological factors. At such a low cost, it is worth the gamble to play and capitalize on the high expected value potential."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 4: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 4,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected payout of the St. Petersburg Paradox game is theoretically infinite, as the sum of the expected values of all possible outcomes diverges. This makes the game mathematically advantageous to play for finite entrance fees such as $4, as the potential rewards far outweigh the cost."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 8: {
    "Entrance Fee": 8,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg paradox game is infinite, calculated as the sum of all potential payoffs weighted by their probabilities: (1/2 * $2) + (1/4 * $4) + (1/8 * $8) + (1/16 * $16) + ... = ∞. While real-world limitations may cap the winnings, the theoretical argument supports playing this game as the expected value far exceeds the $8 entrance fee."
}
Run 2, Fee 16: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 16,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is theoretically infinite because the payoff increases exponentially while the probabilities decrease geometrically. Even though practical considerations such as budget constraints and psychological concerns might suggest otherwise, paying $16 to play this game offers a highly favorable trade-off based on the theoretical expected value. Therefore, I would play."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 32: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 32,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is theoretically infinite due to its payoff structure. However, in practical terms, human decision-making factors in risk aversion, diminishing returns of utility for money, and real-world constraints such as finite resources. Paying $32 for an uncertain game with such volatility is not a rational choice, as the subjective utility does not justify the entrance fee."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 100: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 100,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the expected value of the game is theoretically infinite due to the pot doubling indefinitely with decreasing probabilities, in practical terms, no individual would likely see these extreme outcomes. Given finite resources and diminishing returns, paying $100 for a single round of this game poses an unreasonable risk relative to the payout. The likelihood of winning a significant amount is too low to justify the entrance fee."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 1000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 1000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the expected value of the St. Petersburg game is theoretically infinite due to the structure of the payouts, in practical terms the utility of such a game is constrained by diminishing marginal returns, finite resources, and real-world considerations. Paying $1000 for entrance is excessively high relative to the likelihood of achieving a significant payout, especially when the probability of very high payouts drops exponentially. Thus, it is not worth the risk to invest $1000 in this scenario."
}
Run 2, Fee 10000: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 10000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The St. Petersburg paradox has an infinite expected value in theory, as the payout grows exponentially while probabilities decrease geometrically. However, in practical scenarios, this infinite expected value is not realistic due to external constraints like limited wealth or bounded gameplay duration. Additionally, paying $10,000 for a single round of this game exposes you to high financial risk, as the most likely outcomes (e.g., winning $2, $4, or $8) fall far below the entrance fee. The marginal utility of money and real-world considerations make this an unwise gamble."
}
```
Run 2, Fee 100000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 100000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the expected value of the St. Petersburg paradox game is infinite due to the steadily increasing payouts with decreasing probabilities, in practical terms, paying $100,000 is unrealistic given real-world limitations. The massive risk of losing the entrance fee far outweighs the expected payout, especially considering human utility functions for money, psychological factors, and the finite nature of resources. Therefore, it would be irrational to accept the game at such a high entrance cost."
}
Run 3, Fee 1: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 1,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The St. Petersburg paradox theoretically has an infinite expected value due to the doubling of the pot and the geometric decline of probabilities, meaning the average payoff exceeds any finite entry fee. Thus, paying just $1 provides an overwhelmingly favorable cost-benefit opportunity with highly unlikely but potentially dramatic payouts."
}
```
Run 3, Fee 2: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 2,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is infinite since the sum of the expected payouts (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ...) diverges. Paying only $2 for this game provides an incredibly favorable expected return, making it a rational decision to play."
}
```
Run 3, Fee 4: {
    "Entrance Fee": 4,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is infinite, as the sum of all possible outcomes weighted by their respective probabilities diverges. Since the entrance fee is finite ($4), playing the game provides a theoretically favorable risk-return tradeoff. Even though practical outcomes may vary, the mathematical expectation justifies paying the entrance fee."
}
Run 3, Fee 8: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 8,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite, as the value of each outcome (payoff multiplied by its probability) continues to add up to infinite sums. Even though the entrance fee is $8, the potential payoff far exceeds this cost, making the game mathematically favorable to play despite real-world psychological or financial considerations."
}
```
Run 3, Fee 16: {
    "Entrance Fee": 16,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The St. Petersburg paradox has an infinite expected value due to the doubling payouts and diminishing probabilities, meaning this game, in theory, is worth any finite entrance fee. While real-world considerations such as diminishing marginal utility of money or practical risk tolerance may apply, for a hypothetical game under these rules, the expected payoff exceeds the $16 entrance fee."
}
Run 3, Fee 32: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 32,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game theoretically diverges to infinity due to the structure of the payoffs, but in practical terms, human players typically assign diminishing marginal utility to large payoffs. Considering real-world factors like risk aversion, practical limits on repeated flips, and the finite availability of funds, paying $32 for a game where outcomes are so variable is not economically justifiable."
}
```
Run 3, Fee 100: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 100,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is infinite due to its mathematical structure, but in reality, no gambling party has unlimited funds, and practical constraints, such as capped payouts or limited time, would apply. Additionally, risk aversion, diminishing marginal utility of money, and practical considerations make the game not worth paying $100, as the vast majority of outcomes lead to winnings less than or only slightly greater than the entrance fee."
}

Run 3, Fee 1000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 1000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the theoretical expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite due to the unbounded payoffs, the practical value of the game is limited by factors such as the player's finite resources, the rarity of extremely large payouts, and the psychological impact of gambling such high amounts. Paying $1000 to play such a game is not rational given realistic constraints and diminishing returns for the high-risk nature of the gamble."
}
Run 3, Fee 10000: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 10000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The St. Petersburg paradox involves an expected value that becomes infinite due to the doubling payouts, but practical considerations like finite resources and diminishing marginal utility of money suggest that paying $10,000 is far too risky considering the low probabilities of winning large payouts. The expected utility does not justify the cost of entry in real-world scenarios."

Run 3, Fee 100000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 100000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is theoretically infinite due to the doubling nature of the payouts and the decreasing probabilities per round. However, paying a fixed cost of $100,000 to participate is unreasonable because, in practice, financial limitations and the low likelihood of extremely large payouts make the actual expected utility far lower for most people. Furthermore, human decisions often consider risk tolerance, and the chance of losing the entire $100,000 outweighs the potential infinite theoretical payoff in a real-world scenario."
}
Run 4, Fee 1: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 1,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is infinite, as the sum of all possible outcomes (weighted by their probabilities) leads to an infinite series. Even though the perfect theoretical notion might not be realistic in practice, the cost of $1 is extremely small relative to the potential payouts, making this gamble worth the risk."

{
    "Entrance Fee": 4,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the game is theoretically infinite because the payoff grows exponentially while the probability halves at each step.

    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite, as the sum of probabilities multiplied by their respective payouts diverges.

Run 4, Fee 16: ```json
{
    "Entrance Fee": 16,

    "Entrance Fee": 32,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected value of this game is infinite. Although the probability of reaching higher payouts decreases geometrically, the payouts increase exponentially, which leads to a theoretically infinite expected value.

    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "Although the theoretical expected value of the St. Petersburg game is infinite due to its structure, the actual utility of such a gamble in real-world practical terms is limited. A $100 entry fee is unreasonable because the likelihood of high payoff decreases exponentially while the gain in real-life utility diminishes for most people as payouts grow. This makes the decision irrational unless you can comfortably afford to lose $100 repeatedly without significant impact to your finances. Furthermore, most people value money in a nonlinear way (diminishing marginal utility), so this gamble doesn't justify the cost."

However, real-world humans are risk-averse due to finite resources and psychological factors. Paying $100,000 for entry involves risking a large amount of money for a potential payoff that may not realistically occur within practical constraints such as limited time, computational limits, or the chance the pot gets excessively large.

Even under realistic payout caps, the expected value equals approximately log2 of the maximum payout in dollars, which easily exceeds $2 for any reasonable cap.

    "Entrance Fee": 1,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The game's expected monetary value is infinite (the sum of (1/2^k)*2^k over all k diverges), so any finite entry fee has positive expected value; at $1 the downside is capped at $1 while the upside is unbounded. Even with risk aversion, such a small fee relative to typical wealth makes playing reasonable if losing $1 is tolerable."
}
Run 10, Fee 2: {
    "Entrance Fee": 2,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "With a $2 entry fee and a $2 minimum payout, the worst-case net is $0 (Heads on the first flip), and any tails before the first heads yields a positive net. The expected value is infinite under the idealized rules. Assuming no time costs and guaranteed payment, there is no downside risk and unbounded upside, so playing is rational."
}
Run 10, Fee 4: {
    "Entrance Fee": 4,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "The expected monetary value of the game is infinite because the payout doubles while the probability halves each round, so the sum of probabilities times payoffs diverges. Paying any finite fee, including $4, yields positive expected profit. Even under a realistic logarithmic utility model, the certainty equivalent of the payout is about $4, making this fee fair; absent additional constraints, I choose to play."
}
Run 10, Fee 8: {
    "Entrance Fee": 8,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "Under the stated rules with unbounded payouts and a fair coin, the expected monetary value is infinite because payoff 2^k occurs with probability 1/2^k. A risk-neutral agent should pay any finite fee; $8 qualifies. I accept the variance (75% chance to win $4 or less) because the infinite expectation justifies the stake and I can afford to lose $8. If payouts were capped or utility strongly concave, the decision might change."
}
Run 10, Fee 16: {
    "Entrance Fee": 16,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "The game’s expected monetary value is infinite, but realistic decisions use expected utility with diminishing marginal utility. Under a common utility (e.g., log utility), the certainty equivalent is about $4—far below $16—and even with square-root utility it’s under $6. In a single play there’s an 87.5% chance of winning less than $16, so you most likely lose money. Unless one assumes risk-neutrality, unlimited house capital, and repeated play, paying $16 is not justified."
}
Run 10, Fee 32: {
    "Entrance Fee": 32,
    "Decision": "Play",
    "Justification": "Given the stated rules with no payout cap, the expected value is infinite because the probability of first heads on flip k is 1/2^k and the payoff is 2^k, so the sum of (1/2^k)*2^k over all k diverges. Therefore any finite entry fee, including $32, offers strictly positive expected value. While most single plays yield small winnings (median $2) and real-world risk aversion and bankroll limits matter, under the rules as given a risk-neutral expert would pay $32 and play."
}
Run 10, Fee 100: {
    "Entrance Fee": 100,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the arithmetic expected value is infinite, a rational decision uses diminishing marginal utility and real-world limits. There is a 63/64 (≈98.44%) chance the payout is under $100, so you usually lose the entry fee. With any realistic cap on bankroll or time, the expected value collapses to the cap in flips (e.g., 30 flips → ~$30), far below $100. Under concave utility (or Kelly/log utility), the certainty equivalent is also well under $100. Therefore the $100 ticket is not worthwhile."
}
Run 10, Fee 1000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 1000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "While the expected monetary value is infinite, realistic decision-making uses concave utility (e.g., Kelly/log), yielding a finite certainty equivalent far below $1000. For a single play, you only profit if the first heads occurs on flip 10 or later (payout at least $1024), which has probability 1/512 ≈ 0.195%, so there is about a 99.8% chance of a net loss. The median payout is $2 and even the 99% payout quantile is only around $200. Without repeated-play opportunities or external bankroll considerations, paying $1000 is not rational."
}
Run 10, Fee 10000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 10000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "Although the theoretical expected value is infinite, the payoff distribution is so skewed that paying $10,000 is irrational for a one-off game. The chance of winning at least $10,000 is only 1/8192 (≈0.012%), the median payoff is $2, and with 99.8% probability you win less than $1,024. Under any realistic payout cap (e.g., a $1B cap yields ≈$31 expected value; even a $1T cap yields ≈$41), the expected payout remains tiny relative to $10,000. With risk aversion and real-world limits, the certainty equivalent is far below $10,000, so I pass."
}
Run 10, Fee 100000: {
    "Entrance Fee": 100000,
    "Decision": "Pass",
    "Justification": "Although the game has infinite expected monetary value, the chance to at least break even at a $100,000 entry fee is only 1/65,536 (~0.15%): you profit only if the first heads occurs on or after the 17th flip. Otherwise (99.85% of the time) you receive $65,536 or less, implying a loss of at least $34,464—and there’s a 50% chance you get only $2. The geometric-mean (log-utility) value of a single play is about $4, orders of magnitude below $100,000. Without an astronomically large bankroll or risk-sharing, the downside overwhelmingly dominates, so I pass."
