For Option B, the probability of drawing a red ball is 10/100 (0.10) and the black ball is 90/100 (0.90). The expected value is (0.10 * 500) + (0.90 * 0) = 50 tokens. Both have identical expected value (50 tokens). However, if maximizing expected utility with no explicit penalties for variance, and assuming risk-neutral preferences (which is neutral to both risk and safety), either choice would be rational. Since tokens are valuable and the problem does not specify utility diminishes with variance or that you cannot tolerate a possible outcome of zero, choosing either is mathematically justified. To break the tie: Option B preserves the possibility of a much better outcome (upside), while losing is not explicitly worse than not playing, and the downside is fully known. Therefore, the slight potential for upside justifies Option B. This choice optimizes expected outcomes given the available information.",

The expected value for Option B is (0.3 * 330) + (0.7 * 0) = 99 tokens. While the expected value is very close (99 vs. 100), unless I am highly risk-averse or unable to tolerate receiving 0 tokens, the marginally higher expected value for Option A does not justify abandoning the chance for a substantially higher payoff. However, since tokens are valuable and the difference in expected value is minimal, if I cannot handle the loss or if this is my only opportunity, Option A is mathematically superior due to the slightly higher expected outcome.
