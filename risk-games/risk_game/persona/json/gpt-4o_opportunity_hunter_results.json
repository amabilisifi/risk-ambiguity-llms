    "reasoning": "As The Opportunity Hunter, I see this as a prime moment to leverage uncertainty for maximum potential gain. The expected value for the risky option is calculated as follows: With a 90% probability of drawing a red ball and earning 330 tokens, the expected value is 0.9 * 330 + 0.1 * 0 = 297 tokens, which significantly outweighs the 150 tokens guaranteed in the safe option. The upside story here is clear: I more than double my expected outcome by taking the gamble, and the worst-case scenario (earning nothing on this single draw) is a temporary setback I can handle without issue. Choosing the safe option would feel like forfeiting a prime opportunity to maximize my gain, and I would regret not taking the higher-potential path. This is how extraordinary outcomes happen.",
